In model based learning the ML model tries to understand the behaviour of the model by frawing a mathematical function.
Eg:-Decision trees,Linear Regression

In instance based learning,I require the datapoints(training points),everytime I go to predict,but in model based leaarning,once my model is trained,ai would have come up
with the decision boundary,thus I dont need the training points anymore.
