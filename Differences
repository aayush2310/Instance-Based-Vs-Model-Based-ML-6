1)Prepare the data for model training,No difference.We need to prepare the data i,e. remove outliers,etc.

2)In model based training,train model from training data to estimate model parameters i.e. discover pattern whereas in instance based learning,do not train model,Pattern 
discovery postponed until scoring query received.

3)In MBL,store the model in suitable form whereas in IBL,there is no model to store.
